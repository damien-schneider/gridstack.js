# Gridstack Website

## Technos
### Icons
- Lucide Icons
> We use Lucide Icons for the website, but we copy svg instead of using the lib directly. You can find them [here](https://lucide.dev/)
- Dev icons
(We use the link for now but will be replaced by svg)

### Gridstack
(Of course ðŸ™ƒ)
### Highlight.js
For code highlighting, used in the homepage to have a beautiful code snippet `<pre><code>...</code></pre>`
A custom theme is used, you can find it in the `src/styles/highlight.css` file
### Dev dependencies
- Prettier
For code formatting


> The tailwind.config.js file is useless but make code editor plugins works.
